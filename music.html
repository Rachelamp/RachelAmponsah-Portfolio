                <h2>Music Piece 1: Resin Guitar Build 2024</h2>
                <p>I took on the challenge of building a Stratocaster-style guitar from resin, fake butterflies, and flowers after being inspired by a similar project online. From researching materials and techniques to creating molds, pouring resin, and wiring electronics, the process pushed me to problem-solve and adapt at every stage. Although the guitar was ultimately warped by heat, the project taught me invaluable lessons in creativity, resilience, and technical craftsmanship. It now hangs proudly as “the beautiful guitar that was never heard,” and I’m already planning my next version, a forest-themed design.</p>
